    <h2>How to setup a meeting</h2>
    This first video is the most important - how to setup a meeting.<br/>
    To setup a meeting from SCRATCH, you have to add a Group, then setup a Location for the meeting.<br/>
    You can setup different locations for the same group if a group meets in more than one place.<br/>
    Once you've setup a group and a location for it, you can add as many meetings as you want for that group <br/>
    and location.
